  class Podfile

    # The of the methods defined in this file and the order of the methods is
    # relevant for the documentation generated on CocoaPods/cocoapods.github.com.

    # The Podfile is a specification that describes the dependencies of the
    # targets of one or more Xcode projects. The Podfile always creates an
    # implicit target, named `default`, which links to the first target of the
    # user project.
    #
    # A podfile can be very simple:
    #
    #     pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 1.0'
    #
    # An example of a more complex podfile can be:
    #
    #     platform :ios, '6.0'
    #     inhibit_all_warnings!
    #
    #     xcodeproj `MyProject`
    #
    #     pod 'ObjectiveSugar', '~> 0.5'
    #
    #     target :test do
    #       pod 'OCMock', '~> 2.0.1'
    #     end
    #
    #     post_install do |installer|
    #       installer.project.targets.each do |target|
    #         puts "#{target.name}"
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    module DSL

      # @!group Dependencies
      #   The Podfile specifies the dependencies of each user target.

      # Specifies a dependency of the project.
      #
      # A dependency requirement is defined by the name of the Pod and
      # optionally a list of version requirements.
      #
      # ------
      #
      # When starting out with a project it is likely that you will want to use
      # the latest version of a Pod. If this is the case, simply omit the
      # version requirements.
      #
      #     pod 'SSZipArchive'
      #
      #
      # Later on in the project you may want to freeze to a specific version of
      # a Pod, in which case you can specify that version number.
      #
      #     pod 'Objection', '0.9'
      #
      #
      # Besides no version, or a specific one, it is also possible to use
      # operators:
      #
      # * `> 0.1`    Any version higher than 0.1
      # * `>= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any higher version
      # * `< 0.1`    Any version lower than 0.1
      # * `<= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any lower version
      # * `~> 0.1.2` Version 0.1.2 and the versions upto 0.2, not including 0.2
      #
      # A list of version requirements can be specified for even more fine
      # grained control.
      #
      # For more information, regarding versioning policy, see:
      #
      # * [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
      # * [RubyGems Versioning Policies](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7)
      #
      # Finally, instead of a version, you can specify the `:head` flag. This
      # will use the pod’s latest version spec version, but force the download
      # of the ‘bleeding edge’ version. Use this with caution, as the spec
      # might not be compatible anymore.
      #
      #     pod 'Objection', :head
      #
      # ------
      #
      # If you want to turn off warnings per single pod, you can specify it
      # by setting `inhibit_warnings` to true. By default, it's false
      #
      #     pod 'Objection', inhibit_warnings: true
      #
      # ------
      #
      # Dependencies can be obtained also from external sources.
      #
      # ### From a podspec in the root of a library repo.
      #
      # Sometimes you may want to use the bleeding edge version of a Pod. Or a
      # specific revision. If this is the case, you can specify that with your
      # pod declaration.
      #
      # To use the `master` branch of the repo:
      #
      #   pod 'TTTFormatterKit', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git'
      #
      #
      # Or specify a commit:
      #
      #     pod 'TTTFormatterKit', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git', :commit => '082f8319af'
      #
      #
      # It is important to note, though, that this means that the version will
      # have to satisfy any other dependencies on the Pod by other Pods.
      #
      #
      # The `podspec` file is expected to be in the root of the repo, if this
      # library does not have a `podspec` file in its repo yet, you will have
      # to use one of the approaches outlined in the sections below.
      #
      #
      # ### From a podspec outside a spec repo, for a library without podspec.
      #
      # If a podspec is available from another source outside of the library’s
      # repo. Consider, for instance, a podpsec available via HTTP:
      #
      #     pod 'JSONKit', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/gist/1346394/1d26570f68ca27377a27430c65841a0880395d72/JSONKit.podspec'
      #
      # @note       This method allow a nil name and the raises to be more
      #             informative.
      #
      # @note       Support for inline podspecs has been deprecated.
      #
      # @return     [void]
      #
      def pod(name = nil, *requirements, &block)
        if block
          raise StandardError, "Inline specifications are deprecated. Please store the specification in a `podspec` file."
        end

        unless name
          raise StandardError, "A dependency requires a name."
        end

        @target_definition.target_dependencies << Dependency.new(name, *requirements)
      end

      # arguments are passed the first podspec in the root of the Podfile is
