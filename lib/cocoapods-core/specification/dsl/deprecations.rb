        # @!group Hooks
        #
        #   The specification class provides hooks which are called by
        #   CocoaPods when a Pod is installed.

        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

        # This is a convenience method which gets called after all pods have
        # been downloaded but before they have been installed, and the Xcode
        # project and related files have been generated. Note that this hook is
        # called for each Pods library and only for installations where the Pod
        # is installed.
        #
        # This hook should be used to generate and modify the files of the Pod.
        #
        # It receives the
        # [`Pod::Hooks::PodRepresentation`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/cocoapods/pod/hooks/podrepresentation/)
        # and the
        # [`Pod::Hooks::LibraryRepresentation`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/cocoapods/pod/hooks/libraryrepresentation/)
        # instances.
        #
        # Override this to, for instance, to run any build script.
        #
        # @example
        #
        #   spec.pre_install do |pod, target_definition|
