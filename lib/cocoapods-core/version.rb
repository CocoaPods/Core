  # The Version class stores information about the version of a
  # {Specification}.
  #
  # It is based on the RubyGems class adapted to support head information.
  #
  # ### From RubyGems:
  #
  # The Version class processes string versions into comparable
  # values. A version string should normally be a series of numbers
  # separated by periods. Each part (digits separated by periods) is
  # considered its own number, and these are used for sorting. So for
  # instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than
  # two.
  #
  # If any part contains letters (currently only a-z are supported) then
  # that version is considered prerelease. Versions with a prerelease
  # part in the Nth part sort less than versions with N-1
  # parts. Prerelease parts are sorted alphabetically using the normal
  # Ruby string sorting rules. If a prerelease part contains both
  # letters and numbers, it will be broken into multiple parts to
  # provide expected sort behavior (1.0.a10 becomes 1.0.a.10, and is
  # greater than 1.0.a9).
  #
  # Prereleases sort between real releases (newest to oldest):
  #
  # 1. 1.0
  # 2. 1.0.b1
  # 3. 1.0.a.2
  # 4. 0.9
  #
  class Version < Pod::Vendor::Gem::Version

    # Versioning prerelease support (with a dash). E.g.: 1.0.0-alpha1
